# SaveManager.gd
#
# Saves the game to a file and loads it back. This is the most advanced file in
# the template, so here's the honest advice:
#
#   *** YOU MOSTLY JUST CALL TWO FUNCTIONS — YOU DON'T NEED TO EDIT THIS FILE. ***
#       SaveManager.save_game()   # write everything to disk
#       SaveManager.load_game()   # read it back
#
# Want a node's data to be saved? You don't change THIS file. Instead, you teach
# that node to save itself by doing two things:
#   1. add it to the "savable" group (Node panel > Groups, in the editor), and
#   2. give it two functions: get_snapshot() and apply_snapshot(data).
# This file then finds every "savable" node automatically and handles the rest.
#
# Everything below is the machinery. Read it if you're curious; skip it if not.
